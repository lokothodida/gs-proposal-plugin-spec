# GetSimple Proposal Plugin Specification
This is a proposal specification for how plugin development could eventually look in
a later version of the GetSimple CMS. This is not a repository of usable code, but
a sketch of a possible API for plugin development.

# Aims
* Encapsulate the plugin's environment in a sandbox
* Reduce the usage of global variables
* Modularize the codebase with objects as much as possible
* Provide a more flexible hooking system to allow greater communication between plugins
* Provide a cleaner/simpler interface for getting/saving data
* Provide a simpler interface for accessing GetSimple site data (e.g. settings)

# Plugin Structure
